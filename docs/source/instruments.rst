Instruments
===========

This section contains the data associated with each supported :term:`instrument`. It lists its
available :term:`versions<version>` and the :term:`models<model>` available for each :term:`version`.
The :term:`configurations<configuration>` and their :term:`options<option>` are similarly listed.
All of this information is provided to help with the construction of the
:py:class:`resolution_functions.Instrument` object and subsequent acquisition of the resolution
function.

Furthermore, each page contains a copy of all the data, i.e. all the parameters for all the models,
which can be used for reference.
