How To Add a Version To an Instrument
=====================================

ResINS strives to model all :term:`versions<version>` of any given :term:`INS`
:term:`instrument` - old, new, and planned - but it is inevitable that some will
not be natively supported *yet*. Fortunately, while not as straightforward as
:doc:`creating a new instrument<add_instrument>`, ResINS aims to make adding
new :term:`versions<version>` as simple as possible:

-------------------------------------

Adding a :term:`version` to an :term:`instrument` only locally (without
:ref:`submitting to ResINS<howto-version-resins>`) is the more difficult task
since ResINS does not have an extension/add-ons mechanism. Therefore, to create
a version, it is necessary to resort to either creating an entire instrument or
working with Python dictionaries instead of YAML files:
