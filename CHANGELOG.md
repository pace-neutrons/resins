## [0.1.0](https://github.com/pace-neutrons/resins/releases/tag/0.1.0)

Initial PyPI release. API should be considered unstable between minor
versions until 1.0.

Resolution functions from AbINS (including Pychop) are implemented and
validated. Currently broaden() method operates on "sparse" points; on
dense pre-binned data this is not computationally optimal but gives an
"exact" reference for approximate optimised schemes.
